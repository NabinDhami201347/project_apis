Sure, let's explain the relationships and schema from the above updated schema:

1. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationships:

   - Department to Semester: One department can have multiple semesters, but each semester belongs to only one department. This relationship is represented by the `departmentId` field in the `Semester` model, which references the `id` field of the `Department` model.

   - Semester to Student: One semester can have multiple students, but each student belongs to only one semester. This relationship is represented by the `semesterId` field in the `Student` model, which references the `id` field of the `Semester` model.

   - Semester to Subject: One semester can have multiple subjects, but each subject belongs to only one semester. This relationship is represented by the `semesterId` field in the `Subject` model, which references the `id` field of the `Semester` model.

   - Subject to Book: One subject can have multiple books, but each book belongs to only one subject. This relationship is represented by the `subjectId` field in the `Book` model, which references the `id` field of the `Subject` model.

   - Library to Book: One library can have multiple books, but each book belongs to only one library. This relationship is represented by the `libraryId` field in the `Book` model, which references the `id` field of the `Library` model.

   - Student to Attendance: Each student has one attendance record, and each attendance record belongs to only one student. This relationship is represented by the `studentId` field in the `Attendance` model, which references the `id` field of the `Student` model.

   - Teacher to Subject: One teacher can teach multiple subjects, and each subject can have multiple teachers. This many-to-many relationship is facilitated through the `teachers` field in the `Subject` model, which uses the `Teacher` model as the related model and the `Teacher` model's `subjects` field, which uses the `Subject` model as the related model. This relationship is represented by the `TeacherSubject` relation.

   - Book to Tag: A book can have multiple tags, and a tag can be associated with multiple books. This many-to-many relationship is facilitated through the `tags` field in the `Book` model, which uses the `Tag` model as the related model and the `Tag` model's `books` field, which uses the `Book` model as the related model. This relationship is represented by the `BookTags` relation.

2. One-to-One (1:1) Relationships:

   - Student to StudentProfile: Each student has one profile, and each profile belongs to only one student. This one-to-one relationship is represented by the `studentId` field in the `StudentProfile` model, which references the `id` field of the `Student` model.

   - Teacher to TeacherProfile: Each teacher has one profile, and each profile belongs to only one teacher. This one-to-one relationship is represented by the `teacherId` field in the `TeacherProfile` model, which references the `id` field of the `Teacher` model.

The schema has been updated after applying normalization to split the `Profile` table into `StudentProfile` and `TeacherProfile` tables. This helps to reduce redundancy and data anomalies, resulting in a more structured and normalized database design. Each table represents a specific entity and its attributes, and relationships are defined between the tables to connect related data efficiently. The use of relationships facilitates data retrieval and maintains data integrity within the database.

---

The updated schema has undergone normalization, resulting in a well-structured and efficient database design. The key relationships are:

1. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationships:

   - Each department can have multiple semesters, but each semester belongs to only one department.
   - Each semester can have multiple students, but each student belongs to only one semester.
   - Each semester can have multiple subjects, but each subject belongs to only one semester.
   - Each subject can have multiple books, but each book belongs to only one subject.
   - Each library can have multiple books, but each book belongs to only one library.
   - Each student has one attendance record, and each attendance record belongs to only one student.

2. Many-to-Many (N:M) Relationships:

   - Each subject can have multiple teachers, and each teacher can teach multiple subjects.
   - Each book can have multiple tags, and each tag can be associated with multiple books.

3. One-to-One (1:1) Relationships:
   - Each student has one student profile, and each student profile belongs to only one student.
   - Each teacher has one teacher profile, and each teacher profile belongs to only one teacher.

By normalizing the schema, data duplication is minimized, data integrity is maintained, and the database's overall performance and organization are optimized. The use of relationships allows for efficient retrieval of related data and ensures that data is stored in a structured and consistent manner.
